# Search Functionality Requirements

## Overview
Traceit's search functionality enables users to trace the origins and viral moments of content across the web using AI-powered analysis and semantic understanding.

## Search Input Types

### Supported Input Formats
- **URLs**: Any social media or news site URL
- **Text**: Natural language queries
- **Media**: Images and videos

## Search Process

### 1. Content Analysis
- AI analyzes the input to identify key elements and characteristics
- For media content, AI extracts relevant features and patterns
- For text/URLs, AI parses and understands the semantic meaning

### 2. Search Execution
- AI generates and executes multiple search queries based on analysis
- Searches across various platforms and sources
- Continues searching until confident results are found
- Returns both original source and viral moments

### 3. Results Processing
- Original source displayed in the boxes section
- Viral moments displayed in the table below
- Confidence score included for uncertain results
- Metrics (views, shares) included when available

## Community Features

### Semantic Grouping
- Automatically groups semantically similar searches
- No manual merging/splitting by users
- Users can report incorrect groupings

### Community Comments
- Comments help inform original source identification
- Voting system for comment quality
- Comments are tied to semantic groups

## Technical Requirements

### Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting for free users
- Remove rate limits for paid users
- Specific limits to be determined

### Error Handling
- Suggest similar searches when no source found
- Provide alternative search queries
- Clear error messaging

### Caching
- Implement caching for frequently searched items
- Cache both search results and semantic groupings
- Cache invalidation strategy to be determined

## Future Considerations
- Visualization of viral spread timeline
- More detailed metrics integration
- Enhanced semantic grouping algorithms
- Additional media type support
