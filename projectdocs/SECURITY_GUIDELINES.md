# Security Guidelines for Traceit iOS App

This document outlines the security measures and best practices to be implemented in the Traceit iOS application to protect user data, ensure secure communications, and maintain the integrity of the platform.

## 1. User Authentication & Authorization

### Apple Sign-In
- Implement Sign in with Apple as the primary authentication method
- Support App Attest API to verify the authenticity of app instances
- Store authentication tokens securely in the iOS Keychain

### Session Management
- Use short-lived JWT tokens for API authentication
- Implement secure token refresh mechanisms
- Automatically invalidate sessions after prolonged inactivity (15-30 minutes)
- Support multiple device sign-in with the ability to view and revoke sessions

### Access Control
- Implement role-based access control for moderation features
- Verify user permissions server-side for all privileged actions
- Maintain audit logs for sensitive operations

## 2. Data Protection

### Local Storage Security
- Use Core Data with encryption for persistent storage
- Implement proper NSSecureEncoding for serialized objects
- Store sensitive information (API tokens, credentials) exclusively in the iOS Keychain
- Utilize Apple's Data Protection API with complete protection level for sensitive files

### Sensitive Data Handling
- Never persist raw search queries tied to user identifiers beyond necessary processing time
- Implement secure deletion of temporary files
- Apply content-security measures to user-generated content
- Minimize collection of personally identifiable information (PII)

### User Data Policy
- Provide clear privacy policy within the app
- Implement data export functionality for user data
- Support complete account deletion with proper data purging
- Respect App Tracking Transparency requirements for all analytics

## 3. Network Security

### API Communication
- Enforce TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- Implement certificate pinning to prevent MITM attacks
- Use Alamofire with proper security configurations
- Add request signing for sensitive API endpoints

### Content Delivery
- Validate all downloaded content before rendering
- Use signed URLs for accessing protected resources
- Implement proper CORS policies on backend services
- Set appropriate cache-control headers for sensitive content

### Rate Limiting & Throttling
- Implement client-side throttling for search requests
- Add exponential backoff for failed API requests
- Handle server-side rate limiting gracefully with user feedback

## 4. Input Validation & Content Security

### User Input
- Sanitize all user input before processing or storage
- Implement proper validation for all form fields
- Use parameterized queries for any database operations
- Apply content length restrictions on all user input

### URL Processing
- Validate and sanitize all URLs before processing
- Implement proper URL encoding/decoding
- Handle deep links securely with validation checks

### Content Moderation
- Implement automatic content filtering for community notes
- Use OpenAI GPT-based content screening for toxicity detection
- Support user reporting of inappropriate content
- Apply rate limiting for note submissions to prevent spam

## 5. Third-Party Integration Security

### External APIs
- Store API keys in the Keychain, never in code or user defaults
- Use a proxy service for sensitive third-party API calls when possible
- Audit third-party SDKs for security vulnerabilities
- Isolate third-party code through proper architecture boundaries

### Social Media & News Sources
- Implement proper OAuth flows for social media integrations
- Validate all data received from external sources
- Monitor API deprecation notices from providers
- Maintain backup data sources for critical features

### AI & Vector Database
- Encrypt all data sent to OpenAI and other AI services
- Implement content filtering before sending data to AI services
- Use secure vector database connections with proper authentication
- Monitor for potential prompt injection vulnerabilities

## 6. Code Security

### Secure Coding Practices
- Follow OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)
- Use Swift's strong typing system to prevent type confusion vulnerabilities
- Avoid security anti-patterns like hardcoded credentials
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

### Dependency Management
- Use Swift Package Manager with resolved versions
- Regularly audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
- Set up security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### Application Hardening
- Enable App Transport Security (ATS) with no exceptions when possible
- Implement jailbreak detection for sensitive features
- Use Swift's memory safety features and avoid unsafe code
- Apply proper code obfuscation for sensitive algorithms

## 7. Incident Response & Monitoring

### Logging & Monitoring
- Implement secure logging that excludes sensitive data
- Use Firebase Crashlytics or Sentry for crash reporting
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns or usage
- Establish thresholds for automatic alerts

### Vulnerability Management
- Maintain a responsible disclosure program
- Document security incident response procedures
- Conduct regular security assessments
- Establish a process for emergency patches

### Compliance
- Ensure GDPR compliance for EU users
- Follow Apple's App Store Review Guidelines for privacy
- Implement COPPA compliance if users under 13 may use the app
- Document compliance with relevant industry standards

## 8. Security Testing

### Penetration Testing
- Conduct regular penetration testing
- Perform threat modeling during design phases
- Use static analysis tools in development workflow
- Test for common mobile vulnerabilities (OWASP Mobile Top 10)

### Security Verification
- Verify memory handling for sensitive operations
- Test secure storage implementation
- Validate network security configurations
- Verify proper implementation of cryptographic functions
