## Dependencies & Critical Path

- Authentication system must be completed before community features
- Core search functionality is required before implementing semantic clusters
- Basic result views must be completed before detail views
- API integration is required for most functional testing

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all business logic and services
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Integration tests for API services
- Performance testing for search functionality
- Security testing for authentication and data protection
- Accessibility testing throughout development

This implementation plan is designed to be iterative, with regular testing and refinement throughout the development process. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for adjustments based on feedback and testing results.
